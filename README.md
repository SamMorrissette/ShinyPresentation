# ShinyPresentation
Example apps to showcase the Shiny package in R

## Practice app ideas
- Extend the LiveCoding example to allow users to choose their own dataset. This can either be uploaded or selected form a list of built-in R datasets. 
- Create an app that allows the user to upload a dataset. Perform a simple linear regression on this dataset and show a plot with the result. 
- Create an app using data from data.winnipeg.ca
